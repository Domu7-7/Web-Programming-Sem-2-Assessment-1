<h2>Invincible</h2>
<p>Invincible is an adult animated superhero television series created by Robert Kirkman for the streaming service Amazon Prime Video, based on the Image Comics comic book series of the same name he co-created with Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley. It is produced by Skybound Entertainment, Wind Sun Sky Entertainment, Point Grey Pictures, and Amazon MGM Studios. The series follows teenager Mark Grayson and his transformation into a superhero under the guidance of his father, Nolan Grayson / Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on the planet. During his transformation, Mark finds himself struggling between his personal life and superhero duties, and is forced to prove that he can be the hero that his father is, unaware that there is a sinister conspiracy going on that threatens the world, and will leave him questioning the true nature of his role. Steven Yeun stars in the series as Mark Grayson / Invincible alongside Sandra Oh and J. K. Simmons as Mark's mother and father, respectively, while the remaining cast members have recurring roles.

Invincible premiered in March 2021, concluding its first season of eight episodes in April. Following the season finale, Amazon renewed the series for a second and third season. A prequel special, Invincible: Atom Eve, was released in July 2023, ahead of the eight-episode second season, which was divided into two parts, the first released in November 2023, and the second from March to April 2024. The third season premiered on February 6, 2025 and will also consist of eight episodes. Three months after the second-season finale, Invincible was renewed for a fourth season.

The series has received acclaim from critics, with praise for its animation, action sequences, story, voice performances (particularly Yeun, Oh and Simmons), and emotional weight.</p>

 <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p class="text-block">
	<p><b>Season 1</b></p>
	<p><b>Rotten Tomatoes: 98% (Critics) / 93% (Audience)</b></p>
	<p>Rest assured, this is so much more than just another superhero cartoon. No, this is humor, mystery, drama, romance and science fiction, all rolled up into one absolutely addictive treat.</p>
	<p><b>Season 2</b></p>
	<p><b>Rotten Tomatoes: 100% (Critics) / 89% (Audience)</b></p>
	<p>Invincible Season 2 wipes the floor with every other superhero show; it’s provocative, compulsively watchable TV that upends expectations on its own devastating terms.</p>
	<p><b>Season 3</b></p>
	<p><b>Rotten Tomatoes: 100% (Critics) / 93% (Audience)</b></p>
	<p>Invincible remains outstanding compared to anything else in the superhero canon — especially these days — but its writing and drama are hollower and weaker when measured to the standards of Season 1 and 2.</p>
